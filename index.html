    <h3>Warnings</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The mobile app can't be found on apple (due to contract issues), and you can't publish your games on apple unless you have a certification.</li>
      <li>Installation and connection problems with your mobile app and the desktop app is very common. Your app may not load on your phone if your using desktop app to make you app. Also, desktop app may not load your app either</li>
      <li>There is also problems with downloading the desktop app (which is why we recommend CLI). There is no desktop app for Ubuntu/Linux and for windows, you have to find a special beta-zipfile because the other files for downloading the app results in loading screen that never loads anything.</li>
      <li>Even if you are using the CLI to make you app, it still requires you to download Node.js.</li>
      <li>This software is very outdated because on PhoneGap QAF posts the latest entry was from 2018. Moreover, with the rising popularity of Ionic and Flutter, less and less people use PhoneGap</li>
      <li>Based on the languages you can use (html, javascript, and css) PhoneGap is not all that good for gaming apps.</li>
      <li>You will need libraries for framework</li>
      <li>There are a few feature complications. For example, the a lot of google fonts don't work if you just enter them into the style tag. You would have to go through the additional step of downloading them.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Coding on New App (Desktop App Version)</h3>
        <h5>Coding your app is pretty easy. To make your app, you just have to change the appropriate files. First, let's look at a tree diagram of the relevant files created from the create command.</h5>

        <h5>Based on this diagram, you can easily see that all your html goes into index.html, css goes into the index.css and all javascript goes into the index.js. The other files have their functionalities, but coding your app stays in mainly these three files.</h5>
        <h5>If you enter each of the three files, you see the template code that renders this image:</h5>

        <h5>Here's the templates: </h5>

        <h5>Now insert your code into the three files like so:</h5>

        After you enter all the information, you should see a page like this:

        With the QR code, non-apple phones can download you app! For publishing your apps to say the playstore or apple store,
        this will require extra steps and might require certification.
